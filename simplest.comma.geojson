            "description": "The Community Centre is committed to working in partnership with local people by providing a hub of activities where everyone can feel welcome and safe to come together, build friendships, learn new skills and reduce feelings of isolation. Originally built around 1890, the place served as an electricity generating station for the North London tram network. Abandoned in the course of the XXst century, it was converted into a community centre, named the Mayville Community Centre back then, by residents of the Mayville Estate in the 1970s. In 2004, Mildmay Community Partnership took over the responsibility and management of the centre. Closed for a few years for renovation, the centre re-opened in 2011, as the first Passive House (an energy-efficient building) of the UK. Today, it hosts many charities and events organized for and with local residents. ",
